Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am an Engineering Manager in Fintech and Payments Group ( FPG ) at Flipkart. Me and my team are responsible for democratising data for creating user insights. These insights are used for decision-making in products like Flipkart Pay Later and Flipkart-Axis Cobranded Cards.

I have a Masters degree (M.Tech in Information Technology, 2014) from [IIIT Bangalore](#). I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), Karnataka in 2011. I completed my schooling at [Dandeli](#), a small town in the Western Ghats region. While I am a native of [Lingasugur](#), Bangalore has been my second home since 2017.

My interests are in the area of distributed systems, big data, graphs and blockchain.
