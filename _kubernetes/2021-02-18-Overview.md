**What is a container?**

A container is the runtime instantiation of a _Container Image_. It is a standard Linux process typically 
created through a clone() system call instead of fork() or exec().

There are two states of container
* rest
* running

When at rest, a container is a file( or set of files ) that is saved on disk. It is referred to as Container Image. 

When you type the command to start a container, the Container Engine unpacks the required files and meta-data, then 
hands them off to the Linux kernel. In running state, containers are just a Linux process.

Containers are a good way to bundle and run your applications. In a production environment, you need to manage the containers that run the applications and ensure that there is no downtime.

**What is Kubernetes?**

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.
