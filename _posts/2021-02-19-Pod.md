A Pod is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. It is not a process, but an environment for running container(s).

Two ways of using Pods
* One container per pod
* Multiple cooperating processes forming a single cohesive unit of service. Each process is a single container.

**_POD Specification_**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: 
  labels:
    app: 
spec:
  containers:
    - name: 
      image: 
      imagePullPolicy: 
      command: []
      args: []
      env:
        - name: 
          value: 
      lifecycle:
      livenessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: 
          port: 
          scheme: 
      ports:
        - name: 
          containerPort: 
        - name: 
          containerPort: 
      readinessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: 
          port: 
          scheme: 
      volumeMounts:
        - name: 
          mountPath: 
          readOnly: 
  volumes:
    - name: 
      configMap:
        name: 
```

**_Key Points To Remember_**

*  Name specified in the manifest is a valid DNS subdomain name

* Modifying the pod template or switching to a new pod template has no direct effect on the Pods that already exist.If you change the pod template for a workload resource, that resource needs to create replacement Pods that use the updated template.

* Updating a pod is possible using patch or replace operation, they have limitations on what fields can be updated.

*  All containers in the Pod can access the shared volumes, allowing those containers to share data.

* Containers within a pod can communicate via
>   * localhost ( port space and IP address are shared )
>   * inter-process communication
*  Containers can get access to operating system admin capabilities using **_privileged_**

**_kubectl commands_**
* creation of pod
> $ kubectl apply -f /path/to/podspec

* get all pods
> $ kubectl get pods
> $ kubectl get pods -o wide

* get specific pod
> $ kubectl get pod <pod_name>
>> $ kubectl get pod <pod_name> -o wide

* details of the pod
> $ kubectl describe pod <pod_name>

* delete a pod
> $ kubectl delete pod <pod_name>
